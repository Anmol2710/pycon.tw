        </p>

        <p>
            First of all, thank you considering giving a talk in PyCon Taiwan
            2016. The following will help you submit an successful proposal. We
            will provide the tips to make your proposal strong and informative
            and gaining the best chance of acceptance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Generally you will have the following aspects to think through
            before your proposal:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What's your topic?</li>
            <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
            <li>What will the audience gain after your talk?</li>
            <li>How you organize your talk time?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will ask to fill up the following fields for your proposal:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Category</li>
            <li>Duration</li>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Target Audience</li>
            <li>Abstract</li>
            <li>Python Level</li>
            <li>Objectives</li>
            <li>Detailed Description (optional)</li>
            <li>Outline (optional)</li>
            <li>Supplementary (optional)</li>
            <li>Recording Policy</li>
            <li>Slide Link (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Looks like quite a lot of fields to fill in. Well, you can skip
            those optional fields and the rest of the form will only take you
            about 500 chars to type. But we encourage you to fill most of the
            fields to help reviewer understand your proposal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the fields are for reviewers only so no need to worry about
            spoilers:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Target Audience</li>
            <li>Objectives</li>
            <li>Outline</li>
            <li>Supplementary</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Next we will give more detailed advice on each aspects.</p>

        <h2>Topics and General Advice</h2>
        <p>You can find what accepted talks are about from the previous PyCons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="//tw.pycon.org/2015apac/en/schedule/" target="_blank">PyCon
                APAC 2015</a></li>
            <li><a href="//tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/program/" target="_blank">PyCon
                APAC 2014</a></li>
            <li><a href="//tw.pycon.org/2013/en/program/" target="_blank">PyCon
                TW 2013</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are some proposal examples for different Python levels at the
            end of this page.
        </p>

        <h3>Good Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The abstract or detail description should contain:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Enumerate each of your talk section in outline with estimated
                    time length.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If your topic is not that familiar to normal Pythonistas, make
                    sure you provide sufficient information through links of blog
                    posts, wiki, source codes, or materials that help the
                    understanding of your content.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bad Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Avoid infomercials.<br>
                That is, try not to merely sell your products or how to use them
                in your talk. However, we do welcome talks about how your
                company solve the problem or your open source project that can
                benefit the general attendees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don't assume everyone in the review committee knows you. Please
                always submit a full proposal.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Choose the Python Level?</h2>

        <p>Choosing the Python level <strong>is</strong> important.</p>

        <p>
            Your talk won't be simply accepted because it is either super hard
            or deadly simple. The acceptance correlates with the specified
            Python level and your targeted audience.
        </p>

        <p>
            If your talk is for Python first-timers and it is about your Python
            learning experience and how you solve some tricky issues you face.
            This is a proper proposal. If your talk is about inspecting the
            Python memory usage and coordinating two GC systems together with
            reusing pointers, and you specify your talk as being novice or
            intermediate, it is not a good idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the extreme conditions (like topics above), it will be easy to
            decide. But topics lie somewhere in between are not. Therefore, we
            give more description below to help you find the proper level.
        </p>

        <h4>Novice</h4>
        <p>
            People who have little to none Python knowledge. One can expect them
            to have basic knowledge about Python syntax and control flow (e.g.
            if-else, for loops; functions), but the audience does not understand
            every modules in stdlib, nor the concepts of tricky variables
            visible scope and OOP (and MRO inheritance).
        </p>

        <p>
            Sharing your experience learning Python, leading a community
            perfectly fits in this level. Generally a talk about non-builtin
            Python packages, say pandas and Django, is not a novice talk. Unless
            people can actually learn all the content you give right after your
            talk.
        </p>

        <h4>Intermediate</h4>
        <p>
            The possible applications are more diverse than novice talks.
            Intermediate talks are for those who just learned how Python works
            and wish to know more how it can be used in different tasks. The
            talk topic can be about setting up web frameworks, talking to
            databases, monitoring the web traffic, auto trading in the stock
            market and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            From previous submissions over the past few years, around a half of
            the talks should fall into this category. Note that we may contact
            you to adjust your talk to be novice or experienced based on your
            proposal.
        </p>


        <h4>Experienced</h4>
        <p>
            People coming to experienced talks should have good proficiency of
            audience's Python (or programming) skill.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main difference between intermediate and experienced talks is
            that experienced talks assume more domain knowledge about the talk
            topic. For example, talks about optimization and tool's internals
            should be at this level.
