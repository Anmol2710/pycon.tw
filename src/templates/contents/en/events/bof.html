<p>
    Registration starts from now! This year, BoF is at the end of 2nd conference day (Jun 4).
</p>

<h2>What is BoF?</h2>
<h3>Birds of a feather flock together</h3>
    <p>
        According to Wikipedia, BoF comes from a motto “Birds of a feather flock together.” A BoF session means an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

        Last year, PyCon APAC 2015 is also the year Marty McFly (Movie: Back to the Future II) went through time and space to arrive in 2015. PyCon APAC 2015 has decided to use the  slogan “Back to __future__ II”, we hope PyCon TW lead us to learn how to use Python to practice at individual ideas, or Python applications in different fields.
    </p>
    <p>
