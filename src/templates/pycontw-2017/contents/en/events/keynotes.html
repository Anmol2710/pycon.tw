			Andrew is a member of the Django core team, a Senior Engineer at Eventbrite, and was the original author of the Django migrations framework, its predecessor South, and now writes and maintains the Channels framework. His work mostly focuses on software and systems architecture, and he enjoys nothing more than making systems and tools that other engineers can use to get their jobs done more easily. In his spare time, he enjoys piloting small planes, archery, and attempting to visit every one of the USA's National Parks.
		</p>
		<h4 class="keynote-speaker__bio__header">Building for Failure: Learning lessons from aviation</h4>
		<p>
			Most software is never designed with failure in mind, and the consequences can range from slightly annoying to life-threatening. We'll look at an industry that has already tackled failure incredibly effectively - aviation - and what lessons we can learn from it and apply to our own code, both locally and distributed.

			Python as a language has been around for over 25 years. How has it survived this long, and how can we, as a community, ensure that it sticks around for another 25 years? In this keynote, Dr Russell Keith-Magee will look at the lessons we can learn from the past and present of open source communities, so that we can ensure we have a strong, healthy Python community going into the future.
